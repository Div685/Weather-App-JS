# Weather App

> Weather App using Javascript and openweathermap API. The main goal for this project was to build weather App using webpack, ES6 modules, Async, Promises, and API.
  - I have used function to fetch data from API and display it on a webpage.

> Note: I have not pushed my API key. Kindly generate your own API key from [openweathermap websit](https://openweathermap.org/) and Use it. To generate API key you will have to sign up on the [openweathermap websit](https://openweathermap.org/).
